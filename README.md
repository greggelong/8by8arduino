# 8by8arduino
 code to work with an common cathode 8by8 display and arduino no librarys or drivers
 
 
 the pin out happens to be the same as the common cathode used in
 
 https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/display/RowColumnScanning
 
 I have placed a 220 ohm resistor at each cathode 
 
 and I am using the same 16 pins on arduino
 
 I have made a function to show a 2 dimensional array as the screen
