# 8by8arduino

code to work with a common cathode 8by8 display and Arduino no libraries or drivers

the pin out happens to be the same as the common cathode used in

https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/display/RowColumnScanning

I have placed a 220-ohm resistor at each cathode

and I am using the same 16 pins on Arduino

I have made a function to show a 2-dimensional array as the screen
